# Info
## What this
- me want to learn about flutter and then build something..


# Projects
## setup
* installed.. not sure if need the android sdk and what not.. maybe will come up if a project calls for it.. do want to get into mobile stuffs so im sure just have to find the right guide

## TestDrive
- Hot reload kinda dope.. reloads and saves state
    - works well on vscode if run through Run -> Start Debugging and can use the flutter inspector from flutter sidebar in devtools
    - also easier to do the hot reload and restart

## Next?
keep going from https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/quick
- i think start with
    - learn flutter development (these all seem pretty good)
        - write your first app
        - learn the fundamentals (maybe do this first..?)
        - discover flutter widgets
        - explore samples and tutorials
- then i could see how to integrate to android or ios; same url as above
    - build for other platforms could be cool
        - android / ios
